# ton-coin-toss

## Explanation of the work of the smart-contract
A smart contract is a well-thought-out coin tossing logic with an unpredictable result.

Sending a transaction to contract(1 TON) allows you to win 2, 10 or 0 TON :)

Admin op codes are provided with the withdrawal of the commission, the addition of the balance and the transfer of the entire balance of the contract.
